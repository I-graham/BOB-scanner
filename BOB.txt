If you are selected for or enroll in any of the above opportunities, please inform 
Mr. Blumm ASAP at: hblumm@stuy.edu 
And whichever extra-curricular program, internship, or community service activity 
your child may participate in, they should be sure to ask their 
supervisor/coordinator to write a letter of appreciation before it concludes – it is 
sometimes very difficult to obtain this later on. And the more personal & detailed 
the letter, the better. A copy should then be submitted to the Guidance office 
(Room 236).
